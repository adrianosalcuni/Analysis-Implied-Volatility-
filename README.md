# Analysis Implied Volatility
This document aims to provide a theoretical and practical explanation of implied volatility. The draft is
divided into three parts:
* a first part which will provide theoretical outlines on implied volatility and an implementation of the
algorithm based on the Newton-Raphson method;
* a second part in which the price of the options will be calculated using the Monte Carlo simulation and
compared with the price obtained using the Black and Scholes formula. Furthermore, the respective
implied volatilities will be calculated and compared;
* a third party where the data of the Twitter Inc. company will be downloaded and the implied distribution will be calculated and compared with the log-normal distribution
